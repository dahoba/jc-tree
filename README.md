jc-tree
=======

This project aims to develop Tree as an implementation of Java collection. Java collection has been mysteriously devoid of a tree implementation.

This project tries to remove the deficiency by providing classes which are of Java Collection type and support tree like hierarchical structures.

I have moved Jc-Tree from [Google code](https://code.google.com/p/jc-tree/) to Github and will only maintain this repository.
